+++
A new father and a programmer, residing in the picturesque city of Hangzhou. My professional ethos is built upon a robust foundation of self-motivation and a hands-on approach to engineering, underpinned by a steadfast adherence to methodological principles.

My literary inclinations reveal a preference for the intricate narratives of Jin Yong over the stylistic prowess of Gu Long, and I am drawn to the depth and societal insights of the "social school" in contrast to the rigid structures of the "new orthodox school"

My coding endeavors are primarily rooted in Java and Python, but my personal affections gravitate towards the elegance and expressiveness of Scala and Swift.

For leisure, I indulge in the customization of [programming fonts](https://github.com/zhimoe/programming-fonts) for fun.
